In this scenario the team will be building a full stack web application with python / Django

The project should be using some sort of dependency management app, to streamline the process of installing dependencies on the pipeline. A good choice for python could be poetry. After installing dependencies a linter should run (pylint), as we want the codebase to follow similar style all-around, which will keep reading & upkeeping it in the future easier. If the linter fails, there should be an automatic formatting mechanism (preferred), or the process should fail and stop there. Next stage should be running tests, and again if some test fails, halt the process there. If there were no complaints in code quality / integrity we should follow up with a build step. When build finishes it should be automatically deployed to some sort of staging server, where the team can manually make sure the built project still works as expected. Whenever the app is finished, it will be published to a separate production server.

The team felt like GitHub Actions would be the best choice for their needs, as the project is fully open source, and the developers thought that the working hours that would've been spent setting up some other CI/CD environment, would be better spent building the app itself.
